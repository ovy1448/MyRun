* **About:**
  - It's simple web application for tracking data done with *jQuery*. I'm using *jQuery addon* for more user friendly date and time selection called *"jQuery Timepicker Addon"*. All data is converted into *JSON string* and saved into *Local Storage*, then retrieved as needed. App allows editing already saved data or its removal. Primitive search and sorting incorporated as well.
* **Things i would do differently now:**
  - I wouldn't use *jQuery*, but rather go for true mobile app using either *React Native* or straight with *Java*.
  - I'm not happy with the plugins, there has to be better way then what i initially used.
  - Adding more and better sorting functions.
  - Incorporating GPS function with map. This sounds like fun getting this all to work properly.

I would like to come back to this someday and learn some real mobile app development.
